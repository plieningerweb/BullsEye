#get live data from jEAR interface

#idea is to get livedata from camera and calculate stuff from there
#problem is: maybe possible but quite hard
#better would be to rewrite cuda (c project): the main loop
#it is exactly created for that purpose

#we still can use python to record something and try to run it then
#once it is working, we will do live stuff

#we even can use a remote control to automagically start and stop logging
